# Self-adaptive-pattern-matching
A pattern generator and pattern-matching system for self-adaptive solar energy harvesting systems.

The project includes two branches:

1- Self-adaptive pattern generator that simulates the behavior of solar energy harvesting system according to the changes imposed from the environment.

2- Self-adaptive pattern matching system that matches incomplete models with the previously generated patterns of the self-adaptive system. Finally, it estimates the unknown parameters of the system if need be.

# Technical Specifications
The project is written by JAVA programming language and developed by Netbeans IDE. We have applied the proposed system to a case study about self-adaptive solar energy harvesting system. Formal models of the case study is placed in "Models" directory that is developed in PRISM probabilistic model-checker including the local system and the environment formal models.
