# Self-adaptive-pattern-matching
A pattern generator and matching system for self-adaptive solar energy harvesting systems.

The project includes two branches:

1- Self-adaptive pattern generator that simulates the behavior of solar energy harvesting system according to the changes imposed from the environment.

2- Self-adaptive pattern matching system that matches incomplete models with the previously generated patterns of the self-adaptive system. Finally, it estimates the unknown parameters of the system if need be.
